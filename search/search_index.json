With Apex Agente, you can easily retrieve all available data from the Apex URL or retrieve specific data by hostname. The first feature of Apex Agente allows you to retrieve all data from the Apex URL, giving you a comprehensive view of all datas available. This data can include information on host name, entity id, registration ip, and last registration time. The second feature of Apex Agente allows you to retrieve data specific to a particular host name. This feature is particularly useful if you want to drill down into getting deeper information of a particular host or agent. With this feature, you can retrieve information on a host which included name, entity id, server id, registration ip, connection status, etc. Apex Agente is easy to use and comes with a simple and intuitive user interface. It is designed to work with Trend Micro Apex URL, so you can be confident that the data you retrieve is accurate and up-to-date. Whether you are a security professional, network administrator, or IT manager, Apex Agente is a must-have tool for monitoring the security status of your network and ensuring that your organization stays safe from potential threats.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-apex-agente","text":"","title":"Welcome to Apex Agente."},{"location":"#about-the-project","text":"Apex Agente is a powerful Python application designed to gather data from Trend Micro Apex URL, a cloud-based security platform that provides advanced threat protection for enterprise networks.

If you are in a virtual environment, any packages that you install or upgrade will be local to the environment. If you run into problems, you can just delete and recreate the environment. It's trivial to set up: poetry (strongly recommended) Poetry automatically created virtual environment Activate the environment with: poetry shell Exit your virtual environment using: exit pipenv (recommended) Pipenv automatically created virtual environment Activate the environment with: pipenv shell Exit your virtual environment using: exit pip Create a new virtual environment python3 -m venv venv Activate the environment with: . venv/bin/activate ( Linux / MacOS ) / venv/Scripts/activate ( Windows ) Exit your virtual environment using: deactivate Dependencies Installation \u00b6 Apex Agente has several dependencies that can be installed with poetry or pipenv or pip , ideally by using a virtual environment . Open up a terminal and install all dependencies with: poetry poetry install pipenv pipenv sync pip pip install -r requirements.txt This will automatically install compatible versions of all dependencies. ApexAgente always strives to support the latest versions, so there's no need to install those packages separately. Run Locally \u00b6 To run it locally is pretty simple, just run it with: poetry poetry run app [ --api API KEY ] [ --id APPLICATION ID ] [ --url SERVER URL ] [ --n DEFAULT CONFIGURATION ] poetry pipenv run app [ --api API KEY ] [ --id APPLICATION ID ] [ --url SERVER URL ] [ --n DEFAULT CONFIGURATION ] python3 python3 -m app/main.py [ --api API KEY ] [ --id APPLICATION ID ] [ --url SERVER URL ] [ --n DEFAULT CONFIGURATION ] Information The --api option specifies api key used in the application. The --id option specifies application id used in the application. The --url option serves as base url for the application. The --n options determine whether using the options or use default configuration. If you use --n you do not need to use other options Note: The program can be run without the need for the user to specify any options.
